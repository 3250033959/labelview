**sorry all, because labview has a design problem, so there are some bugs, I'll be re-implemented in the near future.**

Sometimes, we need to show a **label** above an ImageView or any other views. Well, **LabelView** will be able to help you. It's easy to implement as well!

# Import your project

####Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.lid.labelview:lib:0.1.1'
}
```

If it doesn't work, please send me a email `lid.guan@gmail.com` or create an issue.

####Or

Copy [`LabelView.java`](lib/src/main/java/com/lid/lib/LabelView.java) into your project.



# Create a Label

LabelView extends from `TextView` so you can treat it as a `TextView` and use any of its method.

Usage:

```
LabelView label = new LabelView(this);
label.setText("POP");
label.setBackgroundColor(0xff03a9f4);
label.setTargetView(findViewById(R.id.text), 10, LabelView.Gravity.LEFT_TOP);
```
# setTargetView parameters

    setTargetView(findViewById(R.id.text), 10, LabelView.Gravity.LEFT_TOP)

+ The second parameter states the distance between the edge of the bottom view and LabelView **(unit dip)**

+ The third parameter states the side of where LabelView should appear on the bottom view.  (only `LEFT_TOP` and `RIGHT_TOP`)


# remove label

you can use `remove` method. eg:

```
label.remove();
```


# LabelView in BaseAdpter

If you using LabelView in **BaseAdpter** and reuse of **convertView**, you have to generate label ID manual. eg:

```
public View getItemView(int position, View convertView, ViewHolder holder) {

	......
	
    // you have to generate label ID manual
    LabelView label = holder.getView(12345);
    if (label == null) {
        label = new LabelView(this);
        label.setId(12345);
        label.setBackgroundColor(0xffE91E63);
        label.setTargetViewInBaseAdapter(imageView, 138, 10, LabelView.Gravity.LEFT_TOP);
    }
    label.setText(your data);
    return convertView;
}
```

# setTargetViewInBaseAdapter parameters

+ The second parameter means targetView **width (unit dip)**.
